This repository contains the input files necessary to reproduce the production files based on molecular dynamics calculations of choline-chloride:lactic acid deep eutectic solvent. We use the CL&Pol force field (FF1) and two modified versions of it (FF2 and FF3). These modifications address specific structural issues observed in the original force field, particularly concerning hydrogen bond networks and chloride overpolarization.
